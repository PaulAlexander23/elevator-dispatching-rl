    """Multi-lift dispatching with one central controller.

    The action is one choice per lift (`MultiDiscrete`): 0 = up, 1 = down,
    2 = serve; with hall calls, 2 = serve up and 3 = serve down. The reward is
    summed over lifts. `config` (a `BuildingConfig` or a name from `PRESETS`)
    selects the features; the default matches `LiftEnv`, and its "custom" and
    "box" observations are laid out the same way.

    `reward_shaping` adds training-only terms: True for the original shaping
    (+1 per pickup, -0.5 per empty serve), a name from `SHAPINGS`, or a
    `Shaping`. Info always reports the unshaped counts.

    Action modes (``action_mode``):
    - "step": the primitive actions above, one floor or one serve at a time.
    - "target": each lift is given a floor to go to, and opens its doors when
      it gets there; with hall calls the action also picks the direction to
      serve (actions 0..n-1 serve up at floor a, n..2n-1 serve down at floor
      a - n). A lift takes a new target only once it has served the last one,
      so one decision covers a whole trip; actions for busy lifts are ignored.
      The observation gains a final flag per lift: 1 when it is free.

    With ``observe_direction=True`` the observation ends with each lift's last
    direction of travel (custom: 0 none yet, 1 up, 2 down; box: 0, 1, -1), as
    a direction lantern shows. Without it a lift sweeping up and one sweeping
    down look the same, so a sweeping strategy cannot be learned.

    Observation types (``obs_type``), lift fields first, then floors:
    - "custom" (`MultiDiscrete`): per lift its floor and passenger count, plus
      its target floor and status (idle, moving, doors) with kinematics; then
      waiting counts per floor (per floor and direction with hall calls),
      capped at the lift capacity; then, per lift, passengers wanting each floor.
    - "box" (`Box`): per lift its position scaled to [0, 1], plus its target
      floor, velocity (scaled to [-1, 1]) and door timer with kinematics; then
      flags for "someone is waiting" and, per lift, "someone wants this floor".
    - "relative" (`Box`): one block per lift, as seen from that lift: its
      position, load, last direction, status (3 flags), offset to its target,
      velocity, door timer and free flag; then for each floor offset from
      -(n-1) to n-1: inside the building, passengers on board wanting that
      floor, people waiting to go up, people waiting to go down (the same
      count twice without hall calls) and other lifts there. Counts are
      scaled by the capacity (or the number of lifts) and capped at 1. "Is
      anyone waiting ahead of me?" becomes a sum over half a block, instead
      of a comparison the network must learn for every floor.
