"""A configurable multi-lift building simulator.

`BuildingConfig` switches each feature on or off. The default config has the
same dynamics as `LiftSim` (10 floors, one lift, uniform arrivals), and with
the same seed it draws the same random numbers, so it doubles as a parity check.

Features:
- `n_floors`, `n_lifts`: building size. Lifts act in index order within a
  step, so a lower-numbered lift boards passengers first.
- `hall_calls`: waiting passengers press an up or down button. A lift serves
  one direction at a time ("serve up" / "serve down"), and only passengers
  going that way board.
- `traffic`: arrival pattern. "uniform" is the original model; the others mix
  up-peak (lobby to upper floors), interfloor and down-peak (upper floors to
  the lobby) traffic, and "day" moves from morning up-peak through lunch to
  the evening down-peak over one episode.
- `kinematics`: lifts accelerate, cruise and brake between floors, and doors
  take time to open and close. Each step is `step_seconds` long and is
  integrated in `substeps`. A lift only takes a new action when it is idle
  (stopped with its doors closed), except that a lift already travelling can
  be told to carry on one floor further in the same direction.
